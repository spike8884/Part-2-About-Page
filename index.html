    <ul>
        <li>There was nothing then there was I</li>
        <li>I grew up outside and was forced to attend Edgewood</li>
        <li>After high school graduation I enlisted and was gone again</li>
        <li>I was forced out on medical discharge so then I travelled</li>
        <li>Eventually I settled down and had my baby girl who was my world</li>
        <li>Then 8 years later baby girl got a baby brother</li>
        <li>When my daughter was little I joined the I.B.E.W.</li>
        <li>I was really into racing and motorcycles and was laid off from the union</li>
        <li>So I went back to school to get A.S.E. certified and started working as mechanic</li>
        <li>When my son was brand new I was laid off again so went back to school for HVAC at Butler Tech</li>
        <li>Went to alot of wierd places doing HVAC cause I was good at troubleshooting faulty equiupment</li>
        <li>HVAC was not fun or exciting so I started doing general appliance repair</li>
        <li>That led me to computers and electronics but mostly just hardware</li>
        <li>I always wanted to learn software and code since high school but never thought I could</li>
        <li>I have always told my kids they should get into programming and coding but not interested</li>
        <li>I want to work with programming AI or deep learning and get my kids interested</li>
    </ul>
